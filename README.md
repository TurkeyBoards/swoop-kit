# Turkey Swoop Kit Keyboard
The Swoop is a low-profile, split ergonomic keyboard designed for ultimate typing comfort and portability. With its compact, column-staggered layout and refined thumb cluster, the Swoop provides a natural hand position that minimizes strain while maximizing efficiency. Its lightweight, travel-friendly design makes it an excellent choice for both desktop use and on-the-go setups.

When creating our Swoop Kit, we wanted to preserve the sleek, low-profile feel of the original open-source design while adding features that make it even more versatile. Our version supports both wired and wireless builds, has full per-key RGB lighting, and includes support for rotary encoders and OLED displays for enhanced functionality.

Key Features:

 - 36-key split ergonomic layout for comfort and efficiency
 - Supports wired & wireless connectivity (based on installed MCU)
 - Wireless Not offered yet. We are still working on the ZMK firmware
 - Pro Micro and compatible controller support
 - Per-key RGB lighting
 - Low-profile hot-swap Choc v1 switches
 - OLED display support for live stats and layouts
 - Rotary encoder support â€” up to 2 encoders (one on each half)
